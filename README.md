# 📦 Kubernetes Overview

## 1️⃣ What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes (often abbreviated as **K8s**) is an open-source container orchestration platform developed by Google. It automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. Kubernetes helps developers and DevOps teams manage complex applications by handling networking, storage, service discovery, and more—across clusters of hosts.

## 2️⃣ Why Use Kubernetes Instead of Docker Swarm?

While both Kubernetes and Docker Swarm are used for container orchestration, Kubernetes has become the industry standard due to several advantages:

| Feature                | Kubernetes                            | Docker Swarm                      |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Scalability**        | Highly scalable and production-ready   | Less scalable                     |
| **Load Balancing**     | Advanced and built-in                  | Basic                             |
| **Community Support**  | Large, active, and fast-growing        | Smaller community                 |
| **Self-healing**       | Auto-restarts, rescheduling, replication | Basic recovery options            |
| **Declarative configs**| Supported via YAML                     | Limited                           |
| **Rolling updates**    | Native support                         | Basic                             |

Kubernetes is more complex but provides robust features for enterprise-level container orchestration, making it a preferred choice over Docker Swarm.

## 3️⃣ Kubernetes Architecture

![Kubernetes-architecture-diagram-1-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1ff897c-e7a2-45a4-86fc-671a124b8bd2)


Kubernetes has a **master-worker** architecture, consisting of the following core components:

### 🧠 Control Plane (Master Node)
- **API Server**: Acts as the frontend to the Kubernetes control plane.
- **Scheduler**: Assigns work (pods) to worker nodes.
- **Controller Manager**: Maintains the desired state of the cluster.
- **etcd**: Key-value store for storing all cluster data.

### ⚙️ Node (Worker Node)
- **Kubelet**: Agent that runs on each node and communicates with the API server.
- **Kube-proxy**: Handles networking and load-balancing.
- **Container Runtime**: Software like Docker, containerd, or CRI-O used to run containers.

> 💡 **Cluster** = Control Plane + Multiple Worker Nodes

## 4️⃣ How Kubernetes Works

Here's a simplified view of how Kubernetes operates:

1. **User submits a deployment YAML file** to the Kubernetes API server.
2. **API server validates and stores** the configuration in `etcd`.
3. **Scheduler assigns pods** to available worker nodes based on resource availability.
4. **Kubelet runs the pod** using the container runtime (e.g., Docker).
5. **Kube-proxy exposes** services for communication between pods and external users.
6. **Controllers monitor** the state of the system and take action if needed (e.g., restarting a pod if it crashes).

> ✅ Kubernetes continuously reconciles the **desired state** vs **actual state** and ensures the application runs as expected.
